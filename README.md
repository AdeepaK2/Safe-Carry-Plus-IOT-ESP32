# Safe Carry Plus - Smart Luggage

Welcome to the Safe Carry Plus project! This repository contains the code and documentation for our Microcontroller-Based Application Development Project, which aims to create a smart luggage system that enhances travel security and convenience.

## Project Overview

**Project Title:** SAFE CARRY PLUS - SMART LUGGAGE  
**Course:** B22-S2-IN1901 - Microcontroller Based Application Development Project  
**Group:** Group 09 - IT  
**GitHub Repository:** [Safe Carry Plus](https://github.com/AdeepaK2/Safe-Carry-Plus-IOT-ESP32)

## Problem Statement

Travelers often face issues such as:
- Difficulty in tracking the bag's location.
- Lack of secure access control in bags.
- High risk of accidentally leaving the bag behind.
- Unmonitored internal conditions that can damage contents.
- Inadequate visibility inside the bag under low light conditions.
- Challenges in identifying the bag in crowded areas.

## Aim & Objectives

**Aim:**  
To develop a smart luggage system that enhances travel security and convenience through advanced technology, providing reliable and efficient solutions for modern travelers.

**Objectives:**
- Enable finding the location of the bag.
- Employ biometric sensors for secure access control.
- Develop a proximity alert system for enhanced bag security.
- Monitor internal temperature and humidity.
- Integrate a mobile app for control.
- Add interior and exterior lighting for visibility in low-light conditions.
- Display battery percentage on an LCD screen continuously.

## Features

- **Proximity Alerts:** Notify users when they are away from the luggage.
- **Biometric Access:** Fingerprint and remote unlocking.
- **GPS Tracking:** Real-time GPS tracking.
- **Mobile App Control:** Intuitive app interface for seamless control.
- **Lighting:** Internal and external lighting for dim conditions.
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Monitor internal temperature and humidity.
- **Battery Display:** Display battery percentage.
